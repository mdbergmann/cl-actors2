  (:documentation "Interface for creating an actor.

**!!! Attention:** this factory function wraps the `act:make-actor` functionality to something more simple to use. 
Using this function there is no need to use both `act:make-actor`.

`context` is either an `asys:actor-system`, an `ac:actor-context`, or an `act:actor` (any type of actor).
The new actor is created in the given context.

- `:receive` is required and must be a 3-arity lambda with arguments: 1. the actor, 2. the message, 3. the state
  Usually expressed as `(lambda (self msg state))`.
- `:init`: is an optional initialization function with one argument: the actor instance (self).
This represents a 'start' hook that is called after the actor was fully initialized.
- `:destroy`: is an optional destroy function also with the actor instance as argument.
This function allows to unsubsribe from event-stream or such.
- `:state` key can be used to initialize with a state.
- `:dispatcher` key can be used to define the message dispatcher manually.
  Options are `:shared` (default) and `:pinned`.
- `:type` can specify a custom actor class. See `act:make-actor` for more info.
- `:name` to set a specific name to the actor, otherwise a random name will be used."))

(defgeneric find-actors (context path &key test key)
  (:documentation "Returns actors to be found by the criteria of:

- `context`: an `AC:ACTOR-CONTEXT`, or an `ACT:ACTOR` or an `ASYS:ACTOR-SYSTEM` as all three implement `find-actors`.
- `path`: a path designator to be found. This can be just an actor name, like 'foo', then `find-actors` will only look in the given context for the actor. It can also be: 'foo/bar', a relative path, in whcih case `find-actors` will traverse the path (here 'bar' is a child of 'foo') to the last context and will try to find the actor by name there, 'bar' in this case. Also possible is a root path like '/user/foo/bar' which will start traversing contexts started from the root context, which is the actor-system.
- `test`: a 2-arity test function where the 1st argument is the `path`, the 2nd is the a result of the `key` function (which defaults to `ACT-CELL:NAME`, so the name of the actor). The default function for `test` is `STRING=`. However, in case of a multi-subpath `path` both `test` and `key` only apply to the last path component, which designates the actor name to be found.
- `key`: a 1-arie function applied on an actor instance. Defaults to `ACT-CELL:NAME`.

Depending on `test` function the last path component can be used as a wildcard when using a `test` function like `STR:STARTS-WITH-P` or `STR:CONTAINSP` for example."))
