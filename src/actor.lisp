   "This is the `actor` class.

The `actor` does its message handling using the `receive` function.

The `receive` function has to return a `cons` constructed of a message to be sent back to caller (`car`), if applicable, and the new state of the actor (as `cdr`).
I.e.: `(cons <my-response> <my-new-state>)`

There is asynchronous `tell` (no response), a synchronous `ask-s` and asynchronous `ask` which all can be used to send messages to the actor. The 'ask' variants provide a response from the actor where 'tell' is only fire-and-forget.

If the 'send' operation was `ask-s` or `ask` then the `car` part of the `cons` result will be sent back to the caller.
In case of a `tell` operation there will be no response and the `car` of the `cons` is ignored, if there is no sender (see `sender` argument to `tell`). If there is a sender defined (which must be an actor), then the `car` of the `cons` result is sent (using `tell`) to the sender.  
It is possible to specify `:no-reply` as `car` of `cons` in this case (`tell` with sender), which has the effect that the result is _not_ sent to the sender even if one exists. This is for the case that the user wants to handle the state and the notifications to a sender himself. It is useful when the message handling code for a particular message (in `receive`) should be executed in a special thread-pool, because long running operations within `receive` will block the message handling of the actor.

The `:no-reply` result works for `ask` and `tell`, because also `ask` is based on `tell`.
`ask-s` is really only useful if a synchronous result is required and should be avoided otherwise.

To stop an actors message processing in order to cleanup resouces you should `tell` (or `ask-s`) the `:stop` message. It will respond with `:stopped` (in case of `ask(-s)`)."))
